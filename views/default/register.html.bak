         Every secure website will at least hash your password before storing it in a database, except for MD5 hashing. MD5 is almost as bad as being displayed in plaintext because MD5 can 
         <br>be easily cracked. To learn more about MD5 and how hash functions work, <a href='hashing'>click here</a>.</Strong></center>
