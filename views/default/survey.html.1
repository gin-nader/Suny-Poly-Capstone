<h2>
    Phishing Website Example
</h2>

<p>
    <bold>This is an example of a phising website. The first thing you should note is that it does not start with "https://".
    <br>This means it is not using SSL to encrypt the information you type in. In other words, anything you type in here will be stored in plaintext.
    <br>So, whoever owns the database linked to this website will easily be able to see any information you type in here.
    <br>Once again, please use fake information.</bold>
