    <b><br><br>This is how your user data, and the information from the phishing website example is stored in the database.
    <br>If this website was secure, you would not be able to see your own password, credit card number, or social security
    <br>number here. Anyone who has access to the database can see this information like this, and anyone who gains
    <br>access to the database illegaly will see this information. This is why passwords generally get hashed, and
    <br>credit card numbers, and other sensitive information will be encrypted.</b>
